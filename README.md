# Language Hero

Language Hero is a conversational language learning chatbot designed to make language learning accessible, engaging, and fun. Utilizing the power of artificial intelligence, Language Hero provides users with an interactive platform to practice and improve their language skills through conversation with a chatbot that speaks back, enhancing both comprehension and speaking abilities.

## Team Members
- Henry Lue
- Colin Ryan

## Purpose of the Project
The primary goal of Language Hero is to break down the barriers to language learning by providing an easily accessible, conversational AI that users can interact with at any time. By simulating natural conversations, the app aims to improve the user's language skills in a more relaxed and less structured environment compared to traditional language learning tools.

## Tools Utilized
- **Node.js** - For server-side logic and managing backend services.
- **HTML5 & JavaScript** - For creating an interactive and dynamic user interface.
- **GitHub** - For version control and team collaboration.
- **Browserify** - To bring Node.js-style modules to the browser.
- **OpenAI (GPT-4)** - To power the chatbot's conversational abilities.
- **Eleven Labs** - For text-to-speech capabilities, giving our chatbot a voice.
- **Microsoft Azure Speech to Text** - To transcribe user's spoken language, allowing for spoken interaction with the chatbot.

## Challenges Encountered and Solutions
Throughout the development of Language Hero, our team faced several challenges, including:
- **Integrating diverse APIs**: Combining services from OpenAI, Eleven Labs, and Azure required us to navigate different documentation and APIs. We overcame this by dividing the work among team members, each specializing in a particular API integration.
- **Streaming audio data**: Handling streaming audio data for speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionality presented technical hurdles. We addressed these by thoroughly researching and implementing best practices for audio data management in web applications.
- **Uncoopertive AI**: It was difficult to get the AI to format the response as desired.
